<h1> About Me! </h1>
<body>Hello World My name is Adrien Middleton and this is my first time doing something like this. I have always wanted to code and do things in that nature so I am very excited to try this out. Growing up, I always wondered how people did coding within video games and websites. It always amazed me how they did such a thing. I can't wait until we learn more information on how to do these codes and gain the knowledge to do it one day.

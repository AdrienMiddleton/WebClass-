<h2> Main Hobbies</h2>
<body>My main Hobbies range from playing basketball and playing my game. Playing my game is my favorite of the two because its a lot more fun and you have many options when choosing what you want to play.</body>

<h2> <b> Side Hobbies </b></h2>
<body>My side hobbies range from doing work for school or watching shows. I have a lot of shows that I watch that are very good. One of my personal favorites is called "Power". That is one of the best shows on the planet. </body>

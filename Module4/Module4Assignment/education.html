    <h2> Education  </h2>
    <body2>I gruduated from hattiesburg high school with honors. My time in high school was pretty fun. The only I'd say I disliked is that my senior year they had us virtual. I really hate that I was not able to attend the school my senior year. I am currently doing coding lessons here at PRCC! Coding is something I have always wanted to do. Taking courses related to this subject was a dream come true.</body2>

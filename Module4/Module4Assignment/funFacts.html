<body2>Video Games is something I really enjoy. There are lots of games that I play and I have some favorites. Last of Us and Uncharted are my favorite games. They both have amazing stroy telling and are both action adventure games. Those two games were made by a company named Naughty Dog. They are known for their amazing story games and have the best graphics when it comes down to it. Those are two of my favorite games that I enjoy playing.</body2>

    <p> Hello World My name is Adrien Middleton and this is my first time doing something like this. I have always wanted to code and do things in that nature so I am very excited to try this out.
    Growing up, I always wondered how people did coding within videos games and websites. It always amazed me on how they did such thing. I can't wait until we learn more information
    on how to do these codes and gain the knowdledge to do it oneday. </p>
